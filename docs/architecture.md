# Project architecture

This page provides an overview of your project’s architecture.  Use diagrams and descriptive text to explain how the components of your system interact.

## Suggested sections

- **Overview** – summarise the goals and scope of your project.
- **High‑level design** – describe the major components, services or modules and how they interact.
- **Data flow** – explain how data moves through the system.
- **Dependencies** – list external libraries, services or APIs that your project depends on.

Replace this placeholder text with information specific to your project once you have defined its architecture.

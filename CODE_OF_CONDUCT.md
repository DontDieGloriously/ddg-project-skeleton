characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, or
religion【699393086262165†L4-L27】.  We pledge to act and interact in ways that
contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive and healthy community.

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints and experiences.

* Accepting responsibility and apologising to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our
standards of acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair
corrective action in response to any behaviour that they deem
inappropriate, threatening, offensive or harmful【699393086262165†L55-L68】.
Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons
for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also
applies when an individual is officially representing the project or
community in public spaces【699393086262165†L75-L104】.  Examples of
representing our project include using an official e‑mail address, posting
via an official social media account or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be
reported to the project maintainers responsible for enforcement via
<abuse@dontdiegloriously>.  All complaints will be reviewed and investigated
promptly and fairly.

All maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
